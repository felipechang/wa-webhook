# WhatsApp Webhooks

Not meant to be a complete communication solution but a "setup and leave" integration between WhatsApp and other applications (like n8n.io) through webhooks and
REST APIs. Best suited for self-hosted environments and personal use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Uses [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js), so it's not guaranteed you won't be blocked
by using this method. WhatsApp does
not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.**
